# DockerComposeGenerator
Generates a docker-compose.yml from a docker run command, because I am too lazy do it by hand.

I am organizing all my docker containers with docker-compose files, because this way I document all the parameters and can easily reproduce containers I use on different systems.
Since most docker-hub descriptions contain examples as docker-run commands, I am tired to manually convert them to the corresponding docker-compose entries.

I know it is far from complete, but I will add features when I need them. Feel free to add pull-requests.
